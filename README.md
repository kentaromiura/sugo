sugo
====

Sugo is an helper built on top of [polpetta](http://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta), it lets developers testing applications using new transpiler technologies.

Sugo supports TypeScript, ES6, and Facebook React JS and it can be expanded to support any kind of transpilers.

Why should I use sugo?
======================

* polpetta with sugo is way better
* sugo is entirelly written with nano
* sugo has been tested by running it on raspberry pi
* I plan to add useful features in the near future


I have a bit of TODOs in mind, but please feel free to add any suggestion through GitHub Issue


FAQ:
====

Why don't you .gitignore node_modules?
--------------------------------------
Because I want sugo to be ready for testing as soon as one clones the project, even without running `npm install`
