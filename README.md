sugo
====

Sugo is an helper built on top of polpetta, it lets developer testing application using new transpiler technologies,
sugo initially supports only TypeScript and ES6, but it can be expanded to support any kind of transpilers.

Why should I use sugo?
======================

* polpetta with sugo is way better
* sugo is entirelly written with nano
* sugo has been tested by running it on raspberry pi
* I plan to add useful features in the near future


I have a bit of TODOs in mind, but please feel free to add any suggestion through GitHub Issue
